  As a child she would walk to the craft store for beads which led to a love of jewelry making and a desire to learn metalsmithing. After retiring from teaching she moved to Dale Hollow Lake and started Forged by Adria.  Inspired by nature and the beauty of gemstones, Adria uses fire and hammers to transform silver and copper into beautiful works of wearable art.
